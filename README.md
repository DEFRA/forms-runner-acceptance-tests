## Local Development

### Requirements

#### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v22.13.1` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v10`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
nvm use
```

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running local tests

Start the applications you are testing on the URLs configured in `.env` / `.env.sample`, then run:

```bash
npm test
```

### Debugging local tests

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

## Production

### Running the tests

Tests are run from the CDP-Portal under the Test Suites section. Before any changes can be run, a new docker image must be built, this will happen automatically when a pull request is merged into the `main` branch.
You can check the progress of the build under the actions section of this repository. Builds typically take around 1-2 minutes.

The results of the test run are made available in the portal.

## Requirements of CDP Environment Tests

1. Your service builds as a docker container using the `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
   The workflow tags the docker images allowing the CDP Portal to identify how the container should be run on the platform.
   It also ensures its published to the correct docker repository.

2. The Dockerfile's entrypoint script should return exit code of 0 if the test suite passes or 1/>0 if it fails

3. Test reports should be published to S3 using the script in `./bin/publish-tests.sh`. The current runtime publishes the Playwright HTML report from `playwright-report/`.

4. Because the suite now runs Playwright inside the built container, the Docker image installs the Chromium browser during build so the CDP runtime can execute the tests directly.

## Running on GitHub

Alternatively you can run the test suite as a GitHub workflow.
Test runs on GitHub are not able to connect to the CDP Test environments. Instead, they run the tests agains a version of the services running in docker.
A docker compose `compose.yml` is included as a starting point, which includes the databases (mongodb, redis) and infrastructure (localstack) pre-setup.

Steps:

1. Edit the compose.yml to include your services.
2. Modify the scripts in docker/scripts to pre-populate the database, if required and create any localstack resources.
3. Test the setup locally with `docker compose up` and `npm test`
4. Use `.github/workflows/journey-tests.yml`, which calls the local `./run-journey-tests` composite action and uploads the generated `playwright-report` artifact.

By default, the provided workflow will run when triggered manually from GitHub or when triggered by another workflow.

If you want to use the repository exclusively for running docker composed based test suites consider displaying the publish.yml workflow.

## Legacy WDIO files

Some WDIO and BrowserStack configuration files are still present in the repository from the previous test setup, but the current Docker, GitHub workflow, and S3 report publishing flow use Playwright and the HTML report in `playwright-report/`.
